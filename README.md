# Sentiment-analysis-in-code-mixed-language
In this project work we will develop and train various RNN(LSTM & BiLSTM)model which takes any tweets as input and predict sentiment of the tweets and evaluate trained model and use it to generate description for entirely new photographs
# Prerequisite
##### tensorflow: 2.4.0
##### keras: 2.4.3

# Steps
1. Dataset <br />
2. Prepare and preprocess Text Data <br />
3. Develop Deep Learning Model <br />
4. Train and Evaluate Model <br />
5. Predict sentiment of tweets 


## The shared folder contains the following files
##### 1. dataset :  This is the given dataset.
##### 2. hate_speech (1).ipynb, LSTM_with_SemEval_IIITH.ipynb, hatespeech_Bidirectional.ipynb, Bi_LSTM_Glove.ipynb:  This is the colab notebook  <br />
Can simply run this model using the notebook
